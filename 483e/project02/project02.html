                    <h2> Defining The Project </h2>
                    <p> To redesign the website for Half &amp; Half Tea Express. It is a boba shop that sells tas and snacks. Their website is used to show the locations, about the store, and the menu. Their competitors are other boba shops for example, 7 Leaves, Tastea, and Sharetea. All of their websites are up to date and easy navigable. On the other hand, half &amp; half’s website is out-dated and needs a redesign. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2> Understanding Your Audience </h2>
                    <p> The primary audience is the consumers of the boba shop. It ranges from kids to adults. The most popular age group is probably high school and college students. This age group is internet and tech savvy - which means the companies website should be up to date and look good. Website should also be responsive and be mobile-friendly. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2> Developing Site Structure </h2>
                    <p> Needs to have the following pages: 1. Home - has pictures of drinks to advertise, 2. Menu - consists of all of their drinks that are separated into categories, 3. About - What boba is and the history of the store and why they named it that way, 4. Locations - displays all of the locations so people can easily find the store. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2> Visual Design </h2>
                    <p> My goal of this site is to redesign it to be more current and up to date. It should have high quality images and good typography. It should make people want to go to the store and buy their products. I want to also redesign their logo to be used online - on their social media pages - and to be printed on the cups.</p>

                    <h2> The History of Their Name and Logo </h2>
                    <p> Half and Half combines the best elements from different cultures, eastern and western, to create a new and fusion gourmet drink experience. The logo is made up of three Chinese words, “ban, ban, tong,” that represent human characters drawn by creative Chinese calligraphy. A man with a spoon, a women and a pair of chopsticks, a laughing and jumping child with a knife and fork (from left to right). Together these characters represent the mission of Half &amp; Half, to create and offer the best possible drink experience to every man, woman, and child from any background and any culture.</p><br>
                    
                    <h2> Problems I Have with Their Current Logo </h2>
                    <p> The Half &amp; Half chain has different names for locations that serve different things. For example, Half &amp; Half Tea Express serves drinks and only some snacks and Half &amp; Half Good Old Time serves a lot of food dishes and drinks. The chain has 4 different names and also, 4 different logos. Another problem is that the chain’s name, Half &amp; Half, is really small on their logo and does not stand out. Another problem is that it is unclear that their logo is a man, woman, and baby. </p><br>
                    
                    <h2> My Solution </h2>
                    <p> My goal is to create a logo for Half &amp; Half that is consistent with all of their franchises. I want to make their name stand out and legible. I want to also either make the logo of a man, woman, and baby more clear - or remove it and get their mission across through another approach. </p>
